    <h2>2. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our priority. We only share your data when it is absolutely necessary, and always with your awareness or consent. We work with a small number of carefully selected and trusted third-party providers. These partners are vetted for their privacy practices and are only given access to data required to perform their specific tasks.</p>

    <p>We may process or share your data based on the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We only process your personal information for specific purposes when you have explicitly given us permission to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process data when it is necessary for our legitimate business interests, provided it does not override your privacy rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractual Necessity:</strong> If we have a contract with you, we process your personal information as needed to fulfill that contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may be required to disclose certain information to comply with legal obligations such as court orders, subpoenas, or official government requests. <em>In such cases, we will only provide the minimum information legally required — and never more.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Vital Interests:</strong> If necessary to protect your safety or the safety of others, or to prevent fraud or abuse, we may process or disclose data as legally permitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Specifically, we may share your data in the following situations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trusted Third-Party Services:</strong> We work with selected vendors to support services such as hosting, analytics, communication, and infrastructure. These partners only receive the data strictly necessary to perform their services, and they must follow strict data protection policies. Any service that involves sensitive data handling or broader access will always be disclosed to you beforehand.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event of a company merger, sale, or acquisition, your information may be part of the transferred assets — but you will be informed and given options wherever possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information. You are always in control, and we commit to transparency in every part of our data handling process.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We take data security seriously. All personal information is protected using industry-standard technical and organizational measures. We only work with trusted services and infrastructure providers that follow strict security practices. Every effort is made to keep your data safe from unauthorized access, misuse, or loss.</p>

    <p>However, while we strive for maximum security, no method of digital transmission or storage is completely risk-free. We cannot fully guarantee that malicious actors (e.g., hackers or cybercriminals) will never breach our systems, despite all precautions. In the unlikely event of a security incident, we will act swiftly and transparently.</p>

    <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to deliver our services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy. Once your data is no longer needed — or when your account is deleted — we will securely delete or anonymize it. In rare cases where deletion is temporarily impossible (e.g., data stored in encrypted backups), we will restrict further access and processing until secure deletion is feasible.</p>

    <p>We never keep your data "just in case." If we have no legal or business reason to retain it, we remove it — cleanly and safely.</p>
