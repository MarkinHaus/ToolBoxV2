            <p>
                As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages under the general laws. However, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

            <h2>7. Liability for Links</h2>
            <p>
                Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
