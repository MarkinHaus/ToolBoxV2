## Key Goals & Features

ToolBoxV2 aims to simplify the development and usage of digital tools by:

*   **üîå Modularity:** Build applications from reusable Python modules (`mods`) and utilities (`utils`).
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Automation:** Facilitate automation of tasks through CLI interactions and programmable APIs.
*   **üåê Cross-Platform Interfaces:**
    *   Develop **Desktop Applications** using Tauri (Rust + Web UI).
    *   Create **Web Applications** with the `tbjs` frontend framework.
    *   Interact via a robust **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
*   **üöÄ Performance & Safety:** Leverage Rust for backend server components (Actix) and Python for scripting and application logic.
*   **üß© Extensibility:** Easily create and integrate new functions, tools, or full mini-applications.
*   **System Independence:** Strives to make applications and tools runnable across different operating systems.
*   **Unified Development:** Provides a cohesive environment for Python, Rust, and web technologies.
