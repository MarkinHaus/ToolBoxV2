# Installation

## Stable release

To install ToolBox, run this command in your terminal:

```
pip install ToolBoxV2

This is the preferred method to install ToolBox, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed,
this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through
the process.
